# k-color-connectivity
Contains some initial work on edge colorings for detour length paths. Thus far, we successfully check for k-color connectivity, determine minimum detour numbers, and view chord additions as permutations of distance between chord incident vertices. Thus far, and algorithmic approach to minimally k-color connecting a graph has not been implemented, and the proposed solution cannot be determined to halt unless the k-color connection number of any graph is less than 2k-1.
