# Introduction
Contains some initial work on edge colorings for detour length paths. Thus far, we successfully check for <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/63bb9849783d01d91403bc9a5fea12a2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.041505pt height=22.74591pt/>-color connectivity, determine minimum detour numbers, and view chord additions as permutations of distance between chord incident vertices. Thus far, and algorithmic approach to minimally <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/63bb9849783d01d91403bc9a5fea12a2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.041505pt height=22.74591pt/>-color connecting a graph has not been implemented, and the proposed solution cannot be determined to halt unless the <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/63bb9849783d01d91403bc9a5fea12a2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.041505pt height=22.74591pt/>-color connection number of any graph is less than <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/032eab123b74896095dbb01e5d7e6ec2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=45.463935pt height=22.74591pt/>.

A number of intractable problems arise as we begin exploring this topic. Rainbow-connection numbers (Li, Sun 2012) have been determined to be NP-Hard, likewise the computation of detour matrices (Weisstein, Eric W. "Detour Matrix." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DetourMatrix.html) has no efficient algorithm; the problem of <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/63bb9849783d01d91403bc9a5fea12a2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.041505pt height=22.74591pt/>-color connecting a graph relies on both rainbow-connections, and minimum detour numbers. Regarding the programs, the wolfram package makes use of a graph isomorphism module which separates chorded cycles into equivalence classes; this is done using a function map, making it ideal for usage in parallel. The python files generate a set of all chorded cycles and separate them into classes by there detour number.

An approximation of the k-color connection number can be generated using DetourModule.wl, although that package has bugs. It uses all paths of length <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/63bb9849783d01d91403bc9a5fea12a2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.041505pt height=22.74591pt/> or greater to color the graph, depending on how frequently a particular edge occurs in a <img src="https://rawgit.com/ajump2/k-color-connectivity/master/svgs/63bb9849783d01d91403bc9a5fea12a2.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.041505pt height=22.74591pt/> length path.
